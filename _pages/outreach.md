We work with high school students from Ann Arbor's Skyline High school to foster interest in Molecular Dynamics and engineering. We teach them how we can use MD to model processes such as nanoparticle formation. By introducing them to MD simulations, we hope to encourage more students to enter the computational science and engineering disciplines.
