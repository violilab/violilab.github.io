Chloe Luyet speaks on the role the food industry has played in the overuse and misuse of antibiotics, contributing to overwhelming global bacterial resistance in her talk "How Antibiotics Have Failed Us: The Food Industry's Role in a Global Epidemic". It is the overuse and misuse of antibiotics, and resulting bacterial resistance, that necessitates the BlueSky project and the urgency to discover new methods to combat resistant bacteria.

We work with high school students from Ann Arbor's Skyline High school to foster interest in Molecular Dynamics and engineering. We teach them how we can use MD to model processes such as nanoparticle formation. By introducing them to MD simulations, we hope to encourage more students to enter the computational science and engineering disciplines.
