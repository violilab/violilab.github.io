## Welcome to the Violi Lab!

We are dedicated to **interdisciplinary research** at the forefront of nanoscience, where we use **molecular simulations** and **machine learning**.
Our two-pronged mission is to perform **basic research** while addressing **real-world challenges** for maximum societal impact.

Our recent work includes [Geometric Deep Learning](https://geometricdeeplearning.com) for accelerating [molecular dynamics simulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_dynamics) of [nonthermal plasma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonthermal_plasma), ensemble methods for multitask feature selection ([BoUTS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14466) and [JOPLEn](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00303)), and [predicting interactions between proteins and nanoparticles](https://news.umich.edu/nanobiotics-ai-for-discovering-where-and-how-nanoparticles-bind-with-proteins/).
Check out our [news](/news/) tab for more info!

**Join us!**
Make an impact by shaping the future of scientific discovery, nanomaterial design, human health, and environmental stewardship.
