# RESEARCH PROJECT
# Development of a stochastic program that predicts the formation and growth of nanoparticles in high temperature environments.

# We have demonstrated the importance of oxygenation pathways in the kinetic growth of nanoparticle precursors. The findings impact the combustion community and the manufacturing fields where the production of toxic nanoparticles is a growing concern.

# PREVIOUS EDUCATION
# 2011 B.S. Mechanical Engineering, The University of California, Berkeley
