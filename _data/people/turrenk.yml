# INTRODUCTION
# My name is Kirk Turrentine, and I'm currently pursuing a B.S.E. in computer science at the University of Michigan. 

# I am extremely interested in cryptography, protecting personal data, human/computer interaction, and other emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence.

# Previously, I worked with Dr. Violi, through UROP: the UM Undergraduate Research Oppportunity Program.  The work pertained to nano particles and specifically the formation mechanisms of soot precursors in combustion environments.
