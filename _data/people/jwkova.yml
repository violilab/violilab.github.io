# INTRODUCTION AND EDUCATION
# My name is Jake Kovalic and I'm currently an undergraduate in my junior year at The University of Michigan studying Engineering Physics and Computer Science. My academic interests include computational physics and machine learning, as well as applications of physics to computing (like quantum computation). I am a member of the Michigan club ultimate frisbee team and I enjoy being outdoors, travel and cooking.

# RESEARCH
# My work involves developing a method to use DFTB and metadynamics as an alternative to expensive ab initio Density Functional Theory calculations to accurately explore reaction pathways. The investigation began with a small organic system as a test and I hope apply the method to larger, more complex systems
