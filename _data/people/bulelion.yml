# INTRODUCTION
# My name is Qi Wang, a Ph.D. candidate at University of Michigan, major in mechanical engineering with concentration on thermal science. I've been working in the Violi group since 2014 (undergraduate at the time), focusing on stochastic modeling (i.e., SNapS2 code) of nanoparticles (e.g., PACs, CNTs) growth in reactive systems (e.g., flames, CVD). By using kinetic Monte Carlo scheme and generic chemical reactions depending on the chemical sites, SNapS2 is a unique tool for both exploring gas-phase chemistry pathways and studying molecular distributions and properties. My email address is bluelion@umich.edu if you want to reach out. GO BLUE!!!

# CURRENT RESEARCH:
# My current research projects consist of further developing SNapS2 mechanism, applications of SNapS2 on premixed and diffusion flames, as well as quantum chemistry calculations related to PACs formation pathways in combustion environment.

# RESEARCH INTERESTS:
# My research interests include multi-scale simulations of complex systems, nanoparticles growth, soot precursors, kinetic modeling, combustion mechanism, reaction pathways, gas-phase chemistry, aerosols, quantum chemistry calculations.

# TEACHING EXPERIENCE:
# Graduate Student Instructors (GSIs) for MECHENG 235 (W18), 336 (W17), 535 (W17).

# M-Write Writing Fellows for MECHENG 235 (W18, F18).
