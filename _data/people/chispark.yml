# PREVIOUS RESEARCH:
# "The role of molecular properties on the dimerization of aromatic compounds" 
# Recent results have shown the presence and importance of oxygen chemistry during the growth of aromatic compounds, leading to the formation of oxygenated structures that have been identified in various environments. Since the formation of polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAC) bridge the formation of gas-phase species with particle inception, in this work we report a detailed analysis of the effects of molecular characteristics on physical growth of PAC via dimerization.
