Our paper titled "[Machine learning models for Si nanoparticle growth in nonthermal plasma](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6595/adbae1)" has been accepted to the IOP journal [Plasma Sources Science and Technology](https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/0963-0252)!
This project has been a collaborative effort between many students across several years, starting with former PhD student [Xuetao Shi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xuetao-shi/), further developed by former undergraduate student [Jonathan Lin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/linjonathan2001/), and finished by current PhD student [Matt Raymond](mraymond.info).
Many thanks to all involved!
