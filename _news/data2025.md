PhD Candidate [Matt Raymond](/people/mattrmd) presented our work on machine learning for nanoscale interactions at the 2025 Center for Data-Driven Drug Development and Treatment Assessment's (DATA) Industry Advisory Board meeting!

The DATA Center is interested in projects that apply computational methods, data science solutions, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques to solve problems in health care, pharmacy, chemistry, and biomedical engineering, in particular in the areas of drug design, drug repositioning, and treatment assessment.
This meeting hosted a number of companies from the pharmaceutical, healthcare, IT, and AI startup industries as well as representatives of governmental agencies.
