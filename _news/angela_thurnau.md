The Thurnau Professorships are an incredibly sought-after and distinguished honor at the University of Michigan. Nominated tenured faculty must demonstrate a strong commitment to teaching and learning, excellence and innovation in teaching, and dedication to working effectively with a diverse student body, among other dedicated contributions to education ([full criteria](https://www.provost.umich.edu/programs/thurnau/thurnau_guidelines.html)). Professor Violi was a very deserving candidate, being praised by her students for "comprehensively support[ing] her students in finding ways to think innovatively, take chances and find passion in their work”. Congratulations, Angela!
