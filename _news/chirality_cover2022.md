In collaboration with the Kotov group, our paper entitled "Chiral chromatography and surface chirality of carbon nanoparticles" will get the cover of Chirality! 

The image was made with a combination of VMD and GIMP to demonstrate the chiral separation that was achieved for *D*- (black) and *L*-CNPs (red) using teicoplanin (background).
