PhD Pre-Candidate [Matt Raymond](/people/mattrmd) presented his research poster at the [2023 e-HAIL Symposium](https://e-hail.umich.edu/symposium-2023/).
His work, "A Taste of Your Own Medicine: Tracing Butyrate Production in the Gut", used Graphical LASSO to detect [bacterial cross-feeding interactions](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37054671/) in gut microbiome data.
This work was performed with the help of Dr. Clegg Waldron, Prof. [Tom Schmidt](https://lsa.umich.edu/eeb/people/faculty/schmidti.html), Prof. [Angela Violi](/people/avioli), and Dr. [Paolo Elvati](/people/elvati).
