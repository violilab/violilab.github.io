title: Presenting new optimization approaches for tree ensembles
---

PhD Candidate [Matt Raymond](/people/mattrmd) presented his research poster at the [2024 MSSISS Symposium](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/mssiss/mssiss-2024/presentations/#session-seven).
His work, "Joint Optimization of Piecewise Linear Ensembles", proposes a new optimization approach to improve the performance of gradient boosted ensembles.
These machine learning models are state-of-the-art in many settings, so any performance gains will provide direct improvements in many fields.
This work was performed with the help of Matt's co-advisors, Prof. [Clayton Scott](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~cscott/) and Prof. [Angela Violi](/people/avioli).
