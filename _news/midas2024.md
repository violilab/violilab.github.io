[Angela Violi](/people/avioli) has received a [2024 Propelling Original Data Science (PODS) award](https://midas.umich.edu/news/michigan-institute-for-data-ai-society-announces-grant-awardees/) to work on sustainable aviation fuels.
This project seeks to create new designs for Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs) that can be used in current aircraft engines while reducing environmental impact.
By utilizing a machine learning framework, we aim to tailor the SAF formulations that uphold the necessary physical characteristics for compatibility with jet engines.
Our method stands out by generating and analyzing an extensive range of potential SAF options, ensuring the best versions are both environmentally friendly and perform well, getting us closer to a future of cleaner skies.
