PhD Candidate [Matt Raymond](/people/mattrmd) presented his work on [Joint Optimization of Piecewise Linear Ensembles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00303) (JOPLEn) at the [2024 Midwest Machine Learning Symposium](https://midwest-ml.org/2024/) in Minneapolis, MN.
His poster, titled "Joint Optimization Significantly Improves Gradient Boosting" demonstrates the performance improvements and novel regularization approaches possible using this new approach to learning piecewise linear functions.

**a)** shows the training data for some function, **b)** shows the true function, **c)** shows a competing approach, and **d)** shows the function learned by JOPLEn.
