PhD Candidate [Matt Raymond](/people/mattrmd) presented his work on [Joint Optimization of Piecewise Linear Ensembles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00303) (JOPLEn) at the [2024 IEEE International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)](https://2024.ieeemlsp.org) in London, UK.
JOPLEn demonstrates the performance improvements and novel regularization approaches possible using Matt's new approach to learning piecewise linear functions.
