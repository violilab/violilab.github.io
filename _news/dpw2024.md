PhD Candidate [Matt Raymond](/people/mattrmd) gives a talk and a poster presentation (not shown) on his work at the [2024 Dusty Plasma Workshop](https://dpw2024.umn.edu) in Minneapolis, MN.
Matt described his use of [Geometric Deep Learning](http://geometricdeeplearning.com) (GDL) to predict nanoparticle growth in [nonthermal plasma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonthermal_plasma).
This presentation demonstrated that combining GDL with molecular dynamics simulations can save ~50% of the computational cost of nonthermal plasma simulations, and that GDL models can make accurate predictions for nanostructures that were unseen during training.
The abstract can be seen [here](https://dpw2024.umn.edu/sites/dpw2024.umn.edu/files/2024-03/angela_violi_machine_learning_models_for_nanoparticle_growth_in_nonthermal_plasma.pdf).
